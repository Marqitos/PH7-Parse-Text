# Parser for BBCode and Markdown Markup Language

Interpretation for two markup languages, BBCode and Markup with support of HTML5.
They also complement each other with my [parser emoticons](http://github.com/pH-7/PHP-Emoticon-Parser).

Note: The language BBCode is customized by me, I added some extra tags (tags and some do not have the same name).

## Server Requirements
